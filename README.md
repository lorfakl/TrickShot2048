# TrickShot2048
 
This is first mobile game I have created. Turned out pretty well after 124 hours work. [Available for Android Only](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OtyEYvsbE8xMh4xiu0gN04Cm1dLLU-CI/view?usp=sharing) Imagine developing for iOS OMEGALUL 
The finished project is in the refactor branch. There are merge conflicts with master and I didnt feel like resolving them.
